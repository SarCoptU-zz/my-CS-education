# my-CS-education

A project created with HTML, CSS, JS and Flask in the server side.
It is a planner for my online CS education based on Open Source Society University, github repository here:
https://github.com/ossu/computer-science.

It is intended as a checklist to help with motivation and to keep me on track as OSSU will be a rather long 
learning project.

The implementation will be on a local server of choice.
